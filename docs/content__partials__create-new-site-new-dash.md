You can create a new site from your homepage by clicking **+ Create New Site**, or from the **Sites** tab. 

1. Log in to your Pantheon account. 

1. Select <Icon icon="plus" text="Create New Site"/>. 

1. Select WordPress, Drupal with Composer, or Drupal 7, depending upon the framework you wish to use.

   <Alert title="Note" type="info">

   Eligible workspaces can add their own sites to this list! We call these [Custom Upstreams](/guides/custom-upstream), and they function as common start states. Workspaces use them to spin up multiple sites with the same codebase, modules, plugins, themes, etc., and to make quick updates to these sites en masse.

   </Alert>

1. Enter the name and select a region for this site.

  <Alert title="Note" type="info">

  The site name will be prefixed to all [Platform URLs](/guides/domains), which are automatically configured as subdomains of `pantheonsite.io`.

  This name cannot be changed once set.

  </Alert>

1. If this site is to be part of a Professional Workspace, select a Workspace from **Choose a Workspace for the Site**.

1. Click **Continue**. It can take several minutes to create a new site on Pantheon. 

1. Click **Visit your Pantheon Site Dashboard** when the process is complete.
