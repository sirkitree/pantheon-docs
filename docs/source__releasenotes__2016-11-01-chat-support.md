We upgraded the basic ticket experience by replacing it with real time chat. With chat, you get responses to your questions even faster by avoiding the inherent delays in ticket-based systems. In addition to providing support in a more real-time, consultative medium, we're also proud to announce that support is now staffed around the clock all year long, 24/7/365.
