### [Traffic Overages and the Site Plan](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic)

Offers a concise reference for understanding site traffic and site plans.

### [Metrics in the Site Dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic)

### [Traffic Limits and Overages](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic/overages)

Updates to both of these docs help clarify what Pantheon counts as site visits and pages served, and make Pantheon’s policies regarding overages more transparent.

### Inclusive Language

As part of our commitment to more inclusive language, Pantheon recently switched to using `blocklist`/`allowlist`, and [docs.pantheon.io](https://docs.pantheon.io) has renamed its default Git branch to `main`.

Learn more about inclusive language at [Google’s Writing inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation) guide.
