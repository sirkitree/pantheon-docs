* Quicksilver opens up our platform and allows deeper integration and automation by adding hooks for encoding reactions to specific platform workflows. Common uses so far include:
* Automatically sanitizing databases after cloning content from Live
* Marking deployments in New Relic to track improvements or regressions
* Posting notifications to Slack of platform actions
