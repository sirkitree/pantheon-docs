The **Replace Card** button allows you to change the credit card to which a site is being billed, or to update an existing card's billing or expiration information.

1. From the User Dashboard, click the **<Icon icon="gear" /> Account** tab and select **Billing** from the left side.

1. Below the card for which you want to update information, click **Replace Card**.

1. Read the information in the **Are you sure?** modal, and to continue, check the box next to **Yes, I want to continue** and click **Continue**.

1. In the **Add Payment Method** modal, select the card that will be used for the sites, or click **Add Card** to add another credit card.

All changes will take effect with the next billing cycle.
