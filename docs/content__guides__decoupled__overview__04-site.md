This section provides information to help you create your Front-End Site.

## Before You Begin

Confirm the following prerequisites before you create your site:

- The **Front-End-Sites** tab is enabled in your dashboard after onboarding.

- Your site repository is in GitHub.

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) is installed globally.

    - Composer is required for the CMS backends.

- You have a domain to use for the Front-End Site.

- You will use Next.js or Gatsby as the frontend framework.

    <Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

    You can use any JavaScript-based runtime, or any static site generator that outputs HTML/CSS/JS, but Pantheon only fully supports Next.js and Gatsby.

    </Alert>

- (Optional). You are using the latest version of Drupal, or WordPress for the CMS.

- (Optional). If using a pre-configured starter kit template, you will use one of the following combinations:

    - [Drupal and Next.js](/guides/decoupled/drupal-nextjs-frontend-starters/)

    - [WordPress and Next.js](/guides/decoupled/wp-nextjs-frontend-starters/)

    - [WordPress and Gatsby](/guides/decoupled/wp-gatsby-frontend-starters/)

    Other configurations are possible but not fully supported.
