This section provides information on how to use the Next.js + WordPress starter kit.

## Before You Begin

The Pantheon `next-wordpress-starter` uses Next.js and has been tested using
[nodejs v16 with npm v8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before you continue.

- You are using a Git repository and the repository is already connected.
- You are using WordPress as your CMS.
- You have installed and configured your WordPress site using the starter kit configuration.

## Create Your Project on Pantheon

1. [Go to the workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#switch-between-workspaces), then select the **Sites** page.

1. Click the **Front-End Sites** tab and then click **+Create New Site**.

1. Click the **WordPress and Next.js** option, select a repo under **Choose your Git provider**, and then click **Continue**.

1. Select your desired GitHub account and enter the repository name. You can select **Make this a private repository** to provide greater security for your Git repository. You cannot use a . (period) or _ (underscore) for site and Multidev names.

1. Select the desired WordPress CMS backend from the **Link Your CMS** drop-down menu.

1. Select the site environment from which to source the content.

1. Optional. Click **Advanced Settings** to set your:

    - Output directory
    - Build command
    - Environment variables
    - Deployment path

1. Click **Continue**. You are directed to a new page with the site name, deployment, and build information and status.

1. Click **Build Details** to view the build log.

1. Click **View Site** after the build completes to launch your Front-End Site.
