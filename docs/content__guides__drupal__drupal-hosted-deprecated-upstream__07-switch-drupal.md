This page provides steps to switch your site from Drupal to `drupal-composer-managed`, the [Drupal with Composer Upstream](/guides/integrated-composer#get-started-with-integrated-composer) upstream that keeps your site current with general configuration changes recommended by Pantheon.

Use Terminus to change the upstream that your site is tracking:

```bash{promptUser:user}
terminus site:upstream:set $SITE drupal-composer-managed
```
