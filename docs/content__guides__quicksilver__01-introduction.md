Quicksilver hooks into platform workflows to automate your Pantheon WebOps workflow. This allows the platform to run selected scripts automatically every hour, or when a team member triggers the corresponding workflow. There is a [growing set of example scripts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/) available for review and contributions. Several scripts enable additional functionality, including:

- Chat-ops
- Database sanitization
- Deployment logging
- Automated testing operations with a CI server

## WebOps Workflow and Stage

You can specify the workflows you want to [hook](/guides/quicksilver/hooks) into, for example, `deploy` or `sync_code`. You can also specify the workflow stage (`before` or `after`) and the location of the script relative to the root of your site's docroot.

The adapted [slack_notification](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/tree/master/slack_notification) example below provides steps to post to Slack every time you deploy.

1. Commit a [pantheon.yml](/pantheon-yml) file with the following content:

  ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
  api_version: 1

  workflows:
    deploy:
      after:
        - type: webphp
          description: Post deployment notification to Slack
          script: private/scripts/slack_deploy_notification.php
  ```

1. Add the code below if you want the script to automatically log the deployment to New Relic:

  ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
        - type: webphp
          description: Log to New Relic
          script: private/scripts/new_relic_deploy.php
  ```
