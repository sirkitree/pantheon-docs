Pantheon platform email notifications are non-configurable, and are generated by automated Pantheon monitoring or by user actions within the dashboard or workspace.

The emails listed below are received by all users, regardless of their assigned role. Refer to [Roles and Permissions](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams#roles-and-permissions) for more information.

- **New membership:** a site admin-generated invitation to a user. The invited user is not required to have an account yet.

- **Password reset:** a user-generated email sent after submitting a request on the login form.

- **Payment invite:** a site admin-generated invitation to a user to pay for and take over ownership of a site. The invited user is not required to have an account yet.

- **Site deleted:** a site admin-generated notification sent to all site team members when a site is deleted.

- **Workspace invite:** a user-generated invitation to join a workspace. The invited user is not required to have an account yet.

The emails listed below are only received by users who have been assigned to the site admin role.

- **Site plan level change:** a Pantheon-generated notification sent to all site admins and workspace admins when a site's plan is upgraded or downgraded.

- **Site added as supporting workspace:** a Pantheon-generated notification sent to all workspace admins when a site is added to an workspace as a supporting Workspace.
