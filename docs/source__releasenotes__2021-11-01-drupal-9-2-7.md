[Drupal 9.2.7](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.7) is now available for production sites.

To check for available updates, click **Check Now** from the Site Dashboard **Dev** tab.

Drupal 9.2.x will receive security coverage until June 15, 2022. Sites on 9.1.x or earlier should update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.11).
