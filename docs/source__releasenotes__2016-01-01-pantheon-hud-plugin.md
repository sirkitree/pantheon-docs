title: Pantheon HUD Plugin
published_date: "2016-01-01"

We released the [Pantheon HUD plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-hud/). This plugin will:   
- Remind you what environment you're in and let you jump to the others  
- Show some status data about the environment  
- Give you a copy/paste Terminus WP-CLI command starter    
A big thanks to Daniel Bachhuber (of WP-CLI fame) for putting this together. Development is taking place on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-hud/), and as always your pull requests and issues with feature ideas are welcome!
