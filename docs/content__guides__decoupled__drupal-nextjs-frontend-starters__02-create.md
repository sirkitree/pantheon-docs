This section provides information on how to use the Drupal + Next.js frontend starter kit.

## Before You Begin

The Pantheon `next-drupal-starter` uses Next.js and has been tested using [nodejs v16 with npm v8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before you continue:

- You are using a Git repository, and the repository is already connected.
- You are using Drupal as your CMS.
- You have installed and configured your Drupal site using the starter kit configuration.

## Create Your Project on Pantheon

1. [Go to the workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#switch-between-workspaces), then select the **Sites** page.

1. Click the **Front-End Sites** tab and then click **+Create New Site**.

1. Click the **Drupal and Next.js** option, select a repository under **Choose your Git provider**, and then click **Continue**.

1. Select your desired GitHub account and enter the repository name. You can select **Make this a private repository** to provide greater security for your Git repository.

  Site and Multidev names cannot contain a `.` (period) or `_` (underscore).

1. Select the desired Drupal CMS backend from the **Link Your CMS** drop-down menu.

1. Select the site environment from which to source the content.

1. Optional. Click **Advanced Settings** to set your:

   - Output directory
   - Build command
   - Environment variables
   - Deployment path

1. Click **Continue**. You are directed to a new page with the site name, deployment, and build information and status.

1. Click **Build Details** to view the build log.

1. Click **View Site** after the build completes to launch your Front-End Site.
