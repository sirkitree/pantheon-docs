This section provides information on how you can use Secure Runtime Access (SRA) with SSH tunnels to keep your sites secure.

Pantheonâ€™s database services use strong, random passwords and TLS to encrypt communications by default. Customers seeking additional defense can enable Secure Runtime Access (SRA).

SRA actively discards attempts to connect to persistent instances like MySQL databases or SFTP, disregarding the attempt before it reaches the service. When SRA is enabled, the connection attempts to the service will be rejected unless the connection comes through the appropriate [SSH tunnel](/guides/secure-development/ssh-tunnels).

In addition to defense in depth, this feature can be used to enforce role-based permissions by preventing users with a developer role from accessing a live database. It also guarantees that users who are removed from a site team or Workspace can no longer use a saved set of credentials.

## How to Enable SRA on Your Site

Secure Runtime Access is available to [contract](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing?docs) customers with a [Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces) dashboard. [Contact Sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us?docs) to request that SRA be enabled for your site.

## How to Access Runtime Services When SRA Is Enabled

Follow the [Secure Tunnels](/guides/secure-development/ssh-tunnels) doc to create the tunnel and to access resources after SRA is enabled.

### Considerations

Users with Secure Runtime Access must have an active Dashboard session to access database services. The following considerations apply:

- Users cannot access MySQL databases or SFTP unless there is an active Dashboard session. Pantheon determines which user should have access to MySQL databases and SFTP through the SSH key and which user account has the public key.
- CI/CD integrations on sites that have SRA enabled and that rely on any of these services must ensure the integrations create a Dashboard session.
- Dashboard sessions last for a limited time and typically expire after 24 hours. You can start a new Dashboard session by logging into `dashboard.pantheon.io` or running `terminus auth:login`.

## What It Looks Like When a Connection Is Refused

When SRA is enabled and a connection is refused, SSH will respond with the `No route to host` error. To resolve this issue, refer to the troubleshooting section of the [SSH Tunnels](/guides/secure-development/ssh-tunnels) doc.
