Copy any existing configuration from the source site and update the source path as needed to match your configuration folder:

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -avz $SOURCE/config/ $DESTINATION/config/ --delete --delete-after
# From $DESTINATION:
git add config -A
git commit -m "Pull in configuration from source site"
```

It is possible that the Drupal site might have relocated the configuration path to a different location. You can find where your configuration files are via:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus drush $SOURCE_SITE_NAME.dev -- status --fields=config-sync
```

In some cases no files are copied through this step. This is not cause for concern.
