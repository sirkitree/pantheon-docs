## Trigger a Build

You can trigger builds manually in the dashboard or automatically when you merge GitHub changes. You cannot trigger a build from a [linked CMS](/guides/decoupled/overview/manage-settings#cms-settings).

### Trigger a Build in the Dashboard

You can save time by quickly triggering a build from your Overview page.

1. Log in to your Front-End Site workspace and select the **Sites** page.

1. Click the **Front-End Sites** tab and select the site you want to trigger a build for.

1. Click the **Trigger Build** button in the top left corner.

### Trigger a Build with GitHub Merges

A build and deploy process is automatically triggered when you
push code to the default branch of your repository or merge a pull
request to that branch.

You can follow the steps below to observe the build and deployment process in real time. Note that the steps below assume that you have already cloned your Front-End Site repository from GitHub to your local.

1. Check out the `main` branch of your repository.

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout main
    ```

1. Make a change to a file in your repository.

1. Add and commit the change to the `main` branch.

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git add .
    git commit -m <message>
    ```

1. Push the new commit.

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git push
    ```

1. Open your Site Dashboard, navigate to the **Overview** page and locate the **Live Build** section to observe the new build in progress.
