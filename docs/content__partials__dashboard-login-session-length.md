The session length for users logged into the Pantheon Dashboard is 14 hours, after which users are forcibly logged out and prompted to log back in.

[Terminus](/terminus/install) sessions are authenticated via a machine token and refreshed based on activity. After 30 days of inactivity, Terminus users will be prompted to re-authenticate via the `auth:login` command.
