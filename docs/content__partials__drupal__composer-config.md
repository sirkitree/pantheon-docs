Any additional Composer configuration that you have added to your site should be ported over to the new `composer.json` file. This can include configurations related to repositories, minimum-stability, or extra sections.

Use the diff command to get the information you need to copy:

```bash{promptUser:user}
diff -Nup --ignore-all-space $SOURCE/composer.json $DESTINATION/composer.json
```

Commit your changes as needed.
