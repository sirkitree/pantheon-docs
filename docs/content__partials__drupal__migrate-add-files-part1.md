**Files** refer to everything stored inside `sites/default/files`. This usually consists of uploaded images, generated stylesheets, aggregated scripts, etc. Files are not under Git version control and are stored separately from the site's code.

You can use the Pantheon Dashboard, SFTP, or Rsync to upload your site's files.

Follow the steps below to export a `tar.gz` or `.zip` file of your directory files.
