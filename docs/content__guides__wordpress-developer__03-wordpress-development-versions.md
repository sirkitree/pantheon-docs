This section provides information on how to test WordPress core versions.

Pantheon provides [one-click updates](/core-updates) for WordPress within the Site Dashboard for officially launched WordPress core versions. One-click updates for core versions are only available after the new version has been merged into our [upstream](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress). You can test development versions of WordPress by updating through the WordPress Dashboard or via Git.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

Development versions and beta releases are not supported and should not be run on live sites. Testing should be done on a [Multidev](/guides/multidev) environment or within an isolated local environment on a branch other than master.

</Alert>

## Update Core within WordPress Dashboard

1. Set the [connection mode to **SFTP**](/guides/sftp) within the Pantheon Site Dashboard or with [Terminus](/terminus) if you are working on a Multidev environment:

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 terminus connection:set <site>.<env> sftp
 ```

1. Install and activate the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin within the WordPress Dashboard or with Terminus:

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 terminus wp <site>.<env> -- plugin install wordpress-beta-tester --activate --yes
 ```

1. Click **Tools**, select **WordPress Beta Tester**, and select the **update stream** you want to use:
   - [Point release nightlies](https://wordpress.org/download/nightly/): This contains the work that occurs on a branch in preparation for a x.x.x point release. This should be mostly stable but will be available before the branch is ready for beta.
   - [Bleeding edge nightlies](https://wordpress.org/download/beta): Choose this option to test beta releases with the bleeding edge development code which may be unstable at times.

1. Click **Save** to save your selection.

1. Navigate to your **Dashboard**, select **Updates**, and then click **Update Now**.

1. Verify the WordPress version using `terminus wp <site>.<env> -- core version` or check the bottom of any WordPress Dashboard page:

  > You are using a development version (4.5-beta1-36808). Cool! Please stay updated.

1. Review configuration changes within the `wp-config-sample.php` file and add desired changes to `wp-config.php` for testing.

## Update Core Manually with Git

1. Set the [connection mode to **Git**](/connection-modes/#git-connection-mode) within the Pantheon Site Dashboard, or with [Terminus](/terminus) if you are working on a Multidev environment.

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 terminus connection:set <site>.<env> git
 ```

1. Open the [local clone of your site's code repository](/guides/git/git-config#clone-your-site-codebase):

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 git checkout -b "wpcore"
 git remote add WordPress https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress.git
 git fetch WordPress
 ```

1. Determine which update stream you want to use:

    - [Point release nightlies](https://wordpress.org/download/beta-nightly/):
     Run `git tag` to identify the latest development tag, and then merge:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git merge --squash -s recursive -X theirs tags/4.4.2
     ```

    - [Bleeding edge nightlies](https://wordpress.org/download/beta): Choose this option to test beta releases:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git merge --squash -s recursive -X theirs WordPress/master
     ```

1. Review `wp-config-sample.php` and edit `wp-config.php` with any additions you want to test.

1. Push the local branch to Pantheon after you've staged and committed the changes if you are working on a Multidev environment:

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 git commit -am "Update WordPress core to 4.4.2 development version"
 git push origin wpcore
 ```

1. Optional. Select **Multidev**, select **Git Branches**, then select **Create Environment** next to the `wpcore` branch name to create the Multidev from within the Site Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Update Required

WordPress sometimes includes database schema changes in major releases. You might see a notification in the WordPress dashboard to update the database when you update WordPress to the latest version. Update as instructed or via [terminus $site.$env 'wp core update-db'](/terminus).
