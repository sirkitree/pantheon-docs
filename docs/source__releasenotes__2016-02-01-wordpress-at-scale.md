For the past several months weâ€™ve been collecting best practices and resources, and put together [a microsite](https://www.scalewp.io/) to help anyone thinking about scale. The content of the site is a community effort [managed via GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-at-scale)  (pull requests welcome!). See Josh Koenig's [blog post](https://pantheon.io/blog/introducing-wordpress-scale) for more information.
