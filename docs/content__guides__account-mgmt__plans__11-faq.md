### Can I host more than one site on an individual plan?

No. Each online site plan is tied to a single install of the CMS.

### Does Pantheon offer discounts for buying sites in bulk?

Yes. If you are interested in bulk pricing, [Contact our sales team](https://pantheon.io/contact-us?docsplanFAQ) or your dedicated account manager to discuss.

### What if my site's metrics exceed the limit of the Performance Extra Large Plan?

The Performance Extra Large Plan allows for 300,000 monthly visits and 1.5 million monthly page views. High traffic sites should be moved to an [Elite Plan](https://pantheon.io/plans/elite?docsplanFAQ). To learn about moving to an Elite Plan, please [contact us](https://pantheon.io/contact-us?docsplanFAQ).

If you exceed the Performance Extra Large plan limits of 300,000 monthly visits or 1.5 million page views, your site will be upgraded to a Performance 2X Large Plan, which has a limit of 600,000 monthly visits and 3 million monthly page views. The 2X Large plan is not available for purchase via the Site Dashboard, but can be applied by our Support team. Refer to [Pricing](/guides/account-mgmt/plans/pricing) for details.
