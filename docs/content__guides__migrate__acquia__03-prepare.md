8. Choose to either move the contents of Aquia's nested directory `docroot` up and remove the folder, or rename the folder to `web` and set `web_docroot: true` in your `pantheon.yml` file. For more information on nested docroots, see [Serving Sites from the Web Subdirectory](/nested-docroot).

9. Navigate to your Acquia dashboard > click **Manage** > click **Extend**. Click **Uninstall** to uninstall Acquia-specific modules.

10. Adjust any special Acquia configurations related to `env` to ensure compatibility with Pantheon's platform. 

11. Uninstall any Acquia Search modules and the default Drupal core Search module (if still enabled for your site) by navigating to `admin/modules/uninstall` if you plan on using [Pantheon Search](/solr).

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If `query cache` is turned on within the MySQL service (an obsolete setting), you may notice a severe performance drop on Pantheon during the User Acceptance Testing stage of an active migration from Acquia. We recommend that you move to a modern service to avoid this issue.

If you would like to confirm that your performance drop is caused by the obsolete `query cache` MySQL service setting, connect to the MySQL service in Acquiaâ€™s production environment and run the following:

```sql{promptUser: sql}
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_%';
```

High values for the `query_cache_limit` and `query_cache_size` variables will confirm that performance degradation is related to the MySQL `query cache` service setting.

</Alert>
