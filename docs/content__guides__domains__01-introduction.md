A domain name is the web address or URL used to visit your site. The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves human-readable names like `www.example.com` into machine-readable internet protocol (IP) addresses like `127.0.0.1`. All Pantheon sites are accessible via platform domains, and you can easily connect your own custom domain to paid sites.

This guide provides information on how to configure your domain to point to your Pantheon site, as well as:

- DNS propagation
- Platform domains
- Custom domains
- Vanity domains
