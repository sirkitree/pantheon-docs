Pantheon provides powerful on-server and [local development](/guides/local-development) tools for WordPress, including [Terminus](/terminus) and [Multidev](/guides/multidev), as well as a wide-range of integrations, including WP-CLI and JetBrains PhpStorm. This guide provides best practices to help you develop and maintain your WordPress site on Pantheon, including:

- License key management for plugins or themes
- WordPress Core Development Version Test
- XML-RPC attacks
- Cron for WordPress
- Amazon S3 for WordPress

## Site Management

Pantheon allows you to implement WordPress at scale. You can manage your site portfolio from a single dashboard, and deploy code easily across hundreds (or even thousands) of WordPress sites.

You can edit your site directly on Pantheon using SFTP or Git. This includes  managing themes, plugins, content, and database files. All changes are tracked in version control, and your files and databases will automatically be backed up.

You can also use power tools such as [Terminus](/terminus) and [WP-CLI](/guides/wp-cli) to manage your Pantheon WordPress site from the command line, or [Quicksilver](/guides/quicksilver) to use available platform hooks.

## WordPress on Pantheon Quick Start Guide

Consult the [WordPress on Pantheon Quick Start Guide](/guides/wordpress-pantheon) if you are new to WordPress and/or the Pantheon platform. This guide also provides information on how to create a new WordPress site from scratch on Pantheon or migrate an existing WordPress site to the Pantheon platform. You can also find information on the Pantheon migration tool to walk you through the process of installing a plugin on your existing site, and completing the steps to transfer the site to Pantheon.
