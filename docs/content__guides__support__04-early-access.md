## What Is the Early Access Program?

The early access program gives customers and interested users the opportunity to partner with the development team and have access to upcoming features that are still under development. This collaboration allows Pantheon to optimize the implementations before we make them widely available in the official General Availibility (GA) release. 

Pantheon makes decisions on features based on the feedback we receive during the early access program.

The program also lets customers help shape the design of new product and managed services features by giving us feedback on the onboarding experience, thoughts on features, and suggestions on how it can be used. 

Please review Pantheon's [Software Evaluation Licensing Terms](https://legal.pantheon.io/#contract-hkqlbwpxo) for more information about access to our software.

## How Do I Get Support for Early Access Features?

While Pantheon does not have a scope of support for early access products, you may take advantage of the resources in the [Community Slack](/pantheon-community), or during [office hours](https://pantheon.io/developers/office-hours).
