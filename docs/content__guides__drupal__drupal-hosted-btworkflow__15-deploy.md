You should now have all three of the major components of your site imported into Pantheon. Clear your caches on the the Pantheon Dashboard, or with Terminus using the following command:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus drush $SITE.dev cr
  ```

Review the site, then proceed to launch using the [Pantheon Relaunch](/relaunch) documentation.
