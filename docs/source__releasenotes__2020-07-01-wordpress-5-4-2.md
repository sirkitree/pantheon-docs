[WordPress 5.4.2](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/06/wordpress-5-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/) is now available on the Pantheon platform. As part of this release, Pantheon also rolled out a configuration change to [block xmlrpc by default](/guides/wordpress-developer/wordpress-best-practices#disable-xml-rpc-via-pantheonyml). If your site uses xmlrpc, [re-enable it](/pantheon-yml#protected-web-paths-override) before deploying this release to production.
