Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to authenticate against your Identity Provider (IdP) when logging into Pantheon.

Pantheonâ€™s flexible infrastructure does not restrict protocols or ports used for communication. There are also no outbound restrictions for traffic from Pantheon to external services.

## Who is Single Sign-on for?

SSO can help organizations centrally manage their users' identities and provide seamless integration across multiple applications. Numerous Pantheon customers use an SSO solution, including:

- Higher education institutions
- School districts
- Local governments
- Other groups and organizations

## How Does SSO Work?

Pantheon uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for SSO authentication. SAML is an XML-based open standard that transfers identity data between two parties, such as an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP) or web application. SAML streamlines the authentication process by enabling users to access multiple, independent web applications across domains using one set of credentials.

<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

SAML applies to an entire email domain when enabled on Pantheon. You cannot use SAML on a per-site, per-environment, or per-user basis. Refer to [Members of an SSO Organization](/guides/sso/sso-organizations#members-of-an-sso-organization) for more information on internal and external members of an SSO organization.

</Alert>

SAML SSO is included for customers with Diamond Accounts and is available for most [Pantheon Workspaces](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces). If you'd like to upgrade to an eligible Account, please contact [Sales](https://pantheon.io/plans/elite?docs). Agencies interested in SAML SSO should reach out to their Partner Manager for qualification requirements. You must be part of the [Pantheon Partner Program](https://pantheon.io/plans/partner-program?docs) to qualify.
