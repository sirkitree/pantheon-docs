Pantheon does not transfer ownership from one owner to another. Best practice is to own your site in your name with a permanently reachable email.

This section will help you gain access to an account if a site owner has left the agency or project, and you do not have the login information.

### The Email Address is Known
1. Go to the [**Password Reset page**](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/reset-password).
1. Enter the previous owner's email address, and click **Request reset link**.  An email with a reset link will be sent to this address.
1. Work with your email administrator to get the reset link.
1. Use the reset link to sign in, and then update the email address to an existing employee.

### The Email Address is Unknown
If the site is associated with a workspace that has a Pantheon Account Manager, you will need to contact that person in order to request a Support ticket for further assistance. For security and privacy reasons, if the site does not have an Account Manager, Pantheon cannot intercede and forcibly transfer ownership of a site from one user to another.
