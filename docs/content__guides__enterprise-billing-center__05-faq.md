This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Enterprise Billing Center and the Site Portfolio Report.

## Enterprise Billing Center FAQ

### What is the Enterprise Billing Center (EBC)?

The Enterprise Billing Center (EBC) is a part of the Pantheon dashboard where contract customers can access their invoices (related to site plan changes) and Site Portfolio reports.

### Do I have to request access to EBC?

Maybe. The EBC is automatically enabled for some Enterprise customers on the Pantheon dashboard. 
Reach out to your Pantheon account manager if the EBC is not automatically enabled on your dashboard.

### How can I access the EBC?

The EBC can be accessed by Admins through the Pantheon dashboard. Refer to [Access Your Invoices in the Dashboard](/guides/enterprise-billing-center/invoices#access-your-invoices-in-the-dashboard) for more information.

### Can I view and/or download an invoice?

Yes. Click the invoice number in the table on the billing page to open the invoice. You can download the invoice when the invoice opens in the new tab.

### Can I filter invoices?

Yes. You can filter invoices by Year.

### How do I search invoices?

Enter the desired invoice number in the search field on the billing page.

### Can I access credit memos in the EBC?

No. You can not access credit memos in the EBC.

### What if there’s a missing report and/or invoice?

It's unlikely that you will have a missing a report and/or related invoice. However, an invoice might be missing if:

- your invoice doesn’t include site plan changes/charges
- your invoice is generated within 30 days of a contract/amendment
- your invoice is not a positive invoice (you do not owe money)

You can contact your Pantheon account manager if you think there is a missing invoice and/or report that is not the result of one of the situations above.

### Who can I reach out to for support?

Reach out to your account manager and/or respective Pantheon support point of contact for any assistance.

## Site Portfolio Report FAQ

### When are Site Portfolio reports sent?

You’ll receive Site Portfolio Reports through:

- Routine periodic invoicing (yearly or as per contract terms)

- Mid-year invoicing for existing sites with automatic upgrades

- Requests for invoicing submitted to Pantheon

### How Do I know which changes relate to the invoice?

The Site Portfolio Report shows changes that appear in the invoice as charges for any site plan upgrades due to site traffic or new site additions.

The Site Portfolio Report can help you understand your invoice in two aspects:

- Change in Site Plan count

- Change in Site Plan Type

You might be under-utilizing the contract if the invoice exhibits more site plans than on the report. If there is a match between the site plan count and site plan type in invoice and on the report, Pantheon is charging you as expected.

### Can I schedule or request the Site Portfolio report?

Yes. You can submit a request to Pantheon asking for your invoice and the supplemental Site Portfolio Report.

### Where do I go to see the amount I owe for each site?

The total amount owed can be viewed on the invoice linked at the top of the Site Portfolio Report. The invoice only provides the overall total, and does not show how much is owed per site.

### How can I access the Site Portfolio report?

Pantheon’s invoice notification generates and emails the Site Portfolio Report along with a link to the online invoice for contract customers with an active contract. Simply click the link provided in the email to view the report. You can also [access the report in the Enterprise Billing Center](/guides/enterprise-billing-center/interacting#access-the-site-portfolio-report-in-the-dashboard) within the dashboard. You must have Admin privileges to access the Site Portfolio link or the Enterprise Billing Center. The Site Owner can change the user's privileges to Admin or download the Site Portfolio Report and share it if the team member cannot access the link or Enterprise Billing Center.

### Who has access to the Site Portfolio report?

The Site Portfolio Report is emailed to the Site Owner of the account or a team member designated to handle the billing of the account. No other users will receive the email. The Site Portfolio Report can be downloaded by Admin-level users and shared as needed from the email link or from the Enterprise Billing Center. Alternatively, the Site Owner can change the privileges of users who need access to the report to Admin.

### Can I share the Site Portfolio report?

Yes. Any team member with Admin privileges within the Workspace can download and share the report.

### Can I change who receives the email for the Site Portfolio report?

Yes. The Site Portfolio Report is emailed to a team member designated to handle the billing of the account. The current Site Owner must [transfer ownership directly](/guides/legacy-dashboard/site-billing#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site) if another teammate needs to assume site and billing ownership. Only Admin-level users can access the email link to the Site Portfolio Report and the Enterprise Billing Center within the dashboard.

### Can my invoice be blank at any given time frame?

Blank invoices are not expected. However, your Site Portfolio Report can be blank. Blank Site Portfolio Reports are generated when your invoice is an exception. 

The Site Portfolio Report may not be generated or no data will be displayed on the report in the following cases:

- The invoice was generated within the first 30 days of contract / amendment live date

- A credit memo is issued or generated

- The invoice has no charges for site / site plans

- The invoice is not a positive invoice (i.e. it has a negative balance rather than a charge to the customer).

- You are a special-terms customer

### Will invoices be accessible all the time after they are generated or do they expire or archive after certain period of time?

The Site Portfolio Report does not expire during the active contract period. Any invoice pertaining to a new or renewed contract might result in a blank report or no report at all. Any invoice pertaining to a contract amendment might result in a report with no data for the amendment.

### Will credit memo related changes reflect on the report?

No. Credit memo related changes are not reflected on the Site Portfolio Report.

### Why do I see “Not determined” in the Site Owner column? 

Not determined means that the site owner was not specified in the workspace.

### What should I do if the link to the Site Portfolio report is broken?

Contact your Pantheon account manager or [submit a support ticket](/guides/support/support-ticket/#organization-dashboard-support-tab) if the link to view your Site Portfolio Report is broken.

### Who do I contact for support?

Contact your Pantheon account manager or [submit a support ticket](/guides/support/support-ticket/#organization-dashboard-support-tab) if the link to view your Site Portfolio Report is broken.
